# Arduino LM35 Temperature Sensor Project

## Overview

This Arduino project interfaces an LM35 temperature sensor with an Arduino Uno. The onboard LED is controlled based on temperature readings from the sensor. When the temperature falls below 30 degrees Celsius, the LED blinks every 250 milliseconds. If the temperature rises above 30 degrees Celsius, the LED blinks every 500 milliseconds.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- LM35 Temperature Sensor
- Jumper Wires

## Wiring

Connect the LM35 temperature sensor to the Arduino Uno as follows:

- LM35 VCC pin to Arduino 5V
- LM35 GND pin to Arduino GND
- LM35 OUT pin to Arduino Analog pin A0
